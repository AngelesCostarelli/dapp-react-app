## My first Decentralized Application (DAPP) ! ðŸš€ðŸš€

I had to make this proyect as a challenge to apply for a job. 
The requirement was to develop a Dapp that comunicates with Smart Contract deployed on an ethereum blockchain compatible testnet network. The dapp must have a front where data can be stored in the blockchain and where it can be retrieved.

I didn't know anything about programming with blockchain so I got into it and after several hours of study I was able to finish it.

ðŸ’» I used the following tecnologies:
- Node.js
- React.js
- Solidity
- Remix
- Web3.js
- Truffle
